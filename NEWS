- Debugger "list" command carries on where we last left off. By default
  it centers around the selected line. Use list> to force starting at the line.
- Reorganized command-processing code to simplify it, make it more dynamic,
  and allow for better expansion increasing DRYness. As a result
  some short abbreviations of commands have been dropped. Use "alias" 
  to add back any that you want.

- Code reorganization to support subcommands (set/show/info) and allow
  for growth

  http://github.com/rocky/emacs-dbgr instead.
